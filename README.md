# Titanic Survival Prediction

![Titanic](titanic.jpg)

## Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a Logistic Regression model. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and this dataset provides valuable insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and convert categorical variables into numerical format.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the data through visualizations and summary statistics.


3. **Model Building:** A Logistic Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict passenger survival.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook (for running the project notebook)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Hamzeeyy/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
    
2. Navigate to the project folder: cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction

3. Install the required dependencies (if not already installed): pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, build and evaluate the model.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieves [mention your model's performance metrics here, e.g., accuracy of 80%], demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting passenger survival.
